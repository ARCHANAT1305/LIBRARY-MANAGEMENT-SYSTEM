# EXP - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## AIM:
To draw a UML diagram for LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## SRS (Procedure):
### step 1:
Gather information about the system, its components, and user interactions.  
### step 2: 
List the key entities, classes, objects, and relationships that need to be represented.  
### Step 3: 
Identify how the elements interact (e.g., associations, dependencies, inheritance).  
### Step 4: 
Select a UML diagramming tool and start drawing the diagram.  
### Step 5:
Position elements (classes, actors, etc.) on the diagram and draw relationships between them.
